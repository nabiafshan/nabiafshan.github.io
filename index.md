I am interested in the applications of machine learning to computational biology. 

Since May 2021, I've been working as a machine learning enginner at [OccamzRazor](https://www.occamzrazor.com/work). 

I am also in the process of finishing my CS Masters at Sabanci University. My advisor is [Oznur Tastan](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/otastan/). 

Previously, I worked in [Ozlen Konu](http://web2.bilkent.edu.tr/konulab/assoc-prof-ozlen-konu/)'s lab as an undergrad bioinformatics researcher and in [Michele Solimena](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf/plid/forschung/Solimena)'s lab as a wet lab research intern.
